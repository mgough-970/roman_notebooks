    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to calibrate Level 1 (L1; uncalibrated ramp cube) data with the Roman WFI science calibration pipeline RomanCal (Python package name `romancal`) to produce Level 2 (L2; calibrated rate image) exposure level data. To learn more, please visit the [RDox pages on the Exposure Level Pipeline](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/roman-stsci-data-pipelines/exposure-level-pipeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the Roman data levels can be found in the RDox article [Data Levels and Products](https://roman-docs.stsci.edu/data-handbook-home/wfi-data-format/data-levels-and-products). A L1 file contains a single uncalibrated ramp in units of Data Numbers (DN).  L1 files are three-dimensional data cubes, one dimension for time and two dimensions for image coordinates, that are shaped as  arrays with (N resultants, 4096 image rows, 4096 image columns). A resultant contains either one read or the arithmetic mean of multiple reads of the WFI detectors. L2 WFI files are calibrated rate images in instrumental units of DN / second.  They are two-dimensional arrays shaped as (4088 image rows, 4088 image columns). Note the smaller image size of L2 files, which is due to the removal of the 4-pixel border of reference pixels around the image during pipeline processing."
