    """
    PURPOSE
    -------
    Retrieve ancillary reference data files needed for specific Python packages:
        - pandeia
        - STIPS
        - STPSF
        - synphot
    
    This code checks for each package that the appropriate environment variable exists 
    and, if not, it downloads the reference data to the path indicated in the YAML 
    instructions and returns instructions to the user for how to set the variables.
    
    INPUTS
    ------
    dependencies (str): A URL or local path to the YAML definition file for the data 
    dependencies. The code will first check for the existence of the file locally, and 
    if it does not exist then it will assume the input is a URL. The default is the URL 
    of the file on the roman_notebooks GitHub repository. The YAML file should have the 
    following format:
            
        package_name:  # Name of the package
            version:  # Package version number for documentation
            data_url:  # URL for each tarball to pull (can provide multiple, e.g., synphot)
                - URL_1
                ...
                - URL_N
            environment_variable:  # Environment variable to check or set up (e.g., PYSYN_CDBS)
            install_path:  # Parent directory under which to install the reference data
            data_path:  # Name of the folder that the reference data exists in
                
        The variable data_path is appended to install_path to give the final path to the reference
        data in the file system.

    verbose (bool): Print messages to the standard out. Default is False.
        
    RETURNS
    -------
    results (dict): A dictionary for each environment variable with the value equal to the final
        path to which the variable should be set.
